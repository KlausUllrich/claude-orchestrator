# Claude Orchestrator - Master TODO List

*Located with handover documents for easy reference during sessions*

## üî¥ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (Current Session)

### ‚úÖ BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED: Agent Parallelization SOLVED!
- [x] **Discovered the solution**: `run_in_background=True` with Claude CLI
- [x] **Proven**: Main orchestrator never blocks
- [x] **Tested**: 3 parallel Claude agents working simultaneously
- [x] **Implemented**: Working orchestrator system with Python scripts
- [x] **Created**: Visual monitoring with tmux dashboard
- [x] **Documented**: Complete breakthrough in ORCHESTRATOR_BREAKTHROUGH.md

### üéØ NEW DIRECTION: WezTerm-based Guardian System
**Decision Made**: No web dashboard. Focus on WezTerm terminal multiplexing.
**Project Rename**: "Claude Guardian" (better reflects protective/monitoring nature)

### üéØ CORE FUNCTIONALITY TO PRESERVE & IMPROVE
**Current Working UX**: `/session-start` and `/session-end` commands
**Goal**: Transfer these to new system with agent-based monitoring for better, consistent handovers
**Success Metric**: `/session-end` produces reliable, high-quality handovers through agent guidance

### üìã IMMEDIATE: Agent Communication Tests in WezTerm
- [x] **Test 1: Chain Communication** ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL
  - [x] Agent 1 asks Agent 2 to ask Agent 3 for random number
  - [x] Agent 3 ‚Üí Agent 2 ‚Üí Agent 1 (who doubles it)
  - [x] Documented in `test_evidence/01_chain_communication_SUCCESS.md`
  - **Result**: Full chain worked! Number 73 ‚Üí doubled to 146
  - **Key Finding**: Need `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag
  
- [x] **Test 2: Output Reading** ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL
  - [x] Agent 2 creates webpage summary (analyzed nius.de)
  - [x] Agent 1 reads Agent 2's output file WITHOUT BLOCKING
  - [x] Monitor script injected notifications into Agent 1
  - [x] Agent 1 stayed responsive (even told jokes!)
  - [x] Key solution: monitor_and_inject.sh polls MCP for agents
  - [x] Document in `test_evidence/02_output_reading_SUCCESS.md`
  
- [ ] **Test 3: Monitor/Approval Pattern**
  - [ ] Create rules file for ASCII art standards
  - [ ] Agent 1 starts Agent 2 as monitor
  - [ ] Agent 1 creates ASCII painting
  - [ ] Agent 2 evaluates and provides feedback
  - [ ] Loop until Agent 2 approves
  - [ ] Document in `test_evidence/03_monitor_approval.md`

- [ ] **Test 4: Session-End Guardian Pattern (CRITICAL)**
  - [ ] Main agent runs `/session-end` equivalent
  - [ ] Guardian agent monitors handover quality
  - [ ] Guardian ensures all required sections present
  - [ ] Guardian validates no contradictions
  - [ ] Guardian forces improvements if needed
  - [ ] Only approved handover gets saved
  - [ ] Document in `test_evidence/04_session_end_guardian.md`

### üì¶ Installation Requirements Tracking
- [x] WezTerm installed
- [x] Fonts installed (JetBrains Mono, Nerd Fonts)
- [x] Claude CLI with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag support
- [ ] Document all requirements in REQUIREMENTS.txt
- [ ] Create setup.sh for one-click installation

### üîë Key Discoveries from Test 1
- **Agent Independence**: Each agent needs full Claude instance with tools
- **Permission Flag Required**: `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for cross-directory access
- **Prompt Engineering Critical**: Need explicit DO/DON'T instructions
- **Polling Inefficient**: Need event-driven hooks to replace sleep loops
- **Workspace Architecture Works**: agent-per-folder with inputs/outputs proven successful

### Session-End Workflow Fixes (Partially Complete)
- [x] Fix path issues in session-end command - DONE
- [x] Fix handover command syntax - DONE
- [x] Fix workflow order (sequential, one-by-one) - DONE THIS SESSION
- [x] Implement project root finding function - DONE THIS SESSION
- [x] Add recommendations logic for findings - DONE THIS SESSION
- [x] Improve sub-agent display format - DONE THIS SESSION
- [ ] **FIX: Git section doesn't execute automatically** - Agent skips to summary instead
- [ ] Test with single task only: unreferenced_documents_check
- [ ] Test full flow: session-start ‚Üí work ‚Üí session-end ‚Üí handover

### After Session-End Works
- [ ] Create TODO tracking system using database
