# Session Handover - Handover System Redesign

## üî¥ MANDATORY READS (EVERY SESSION)

**Read these documents in order - NO EXCEPTIONS:**

### 1. Core Project Rules 
- [ ] `/docs/status/read-first.md` - must be read in full!

### 2. Current Task Context
- [ ] This entire handover document
- [ ] Previous session handover: `/docs/status/archive/handover-archived-20250810-1104.md`

### 3. Task-Specific Required Reading
- [ ] `/docs/status/users-todos.md` - **Why Required**: Master TODO list to understand priorities
- [ ] `claude-orchestrator/brain/handover-manager.py` - **Why Required**: Core implementation just redesigned
- [ ] `.claude/commands/handover.md` - **Why Required**: Understand the new LLM-driven process
- [ ] `claude-orchestrator/resource-library/documents/handovers/Session_Handover_Template.md` - **Why Required**: The template to follow

**üí° Better to spend tokens on proper onboarding than waste sessions debugging**

## Orchestrator Understanding
**Check Understanding:**
Before starting, confirm you understand:
- [ ] How commands flow: User ‚Üí Claude ‚Üí Commands ‚Üí orchestrate.py ‚Üí Python scripts
- [ ] Where documents are stored: docs/status/ for handovers, docs/ for project docs
- [ ] Where databases live: `claude-orchestrator/short-term-memory/`
- [ ] What works vs what's TODO: Commands executable but handover needs LLM to create content

## üìç Current Development State

### Project Status
**Phase**: Foundation Building - Making Core Commands Work
**Sub-Phase**: Handover System Implementation
**Overall Progress**: Commands infrastructure complete, needs testing and refinement

### Last Session Summary
**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Created `brain/handover-manager.py` with helper functions for LLM
- ‚úÖ Redesigned architecture to be LLM-driven, not Python-generated
- ‚úÖ Fixed import issues with hyphenated filenames using importlib
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive `/handover` command documentation
- ‚úÖ Enhanced information gathering to include previous handover context
- ‚úÖ Created `docs/read-first.md` as mandatory reading list

**Not Completed**:
- ‚ùå Full testing of handover creation flow - We redesigned mid-session
- ‚ùå Session-start command testing - Deprioritized for architecture fix
- ‚ùå Database schema issues not resolved - Still have warnings about missing tables
- **Why**: Discovered fundamental flaw in approach that needed immediate fixing
- **Impact**: Next session needs to test the new LLM-driven approach

## üéØ This Session Goal

### Primary Objective
Test and refine the LLM-driven handover creation process to ensure it creates comprehensive, useful handovers

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Successfully create a handover using the new LLM-driven approach
- [ ] Test `/session-start` command with the new handover format
- [ ] Verify the full workflow: session-start ‚Üí work ‚Üí handover
- [ ] User verification that handovers are now comprehensive and useful

### Time Boxing
- If handover creation doesn't work smoothly in 2 attempts ‚Üí investigate integration issues
- Focus on making the core flow work before adding enhancements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warnings & Known Issues

### Architecture Warnings
**Python Module Naming**: Our convention uses hyphens (kebab-case) but Python imports need underscores. We use `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` to handle this.

### Active Blockers
1. **Database Schema Issues**: Missing 'tasks' table, 'created_at' column errors
   - **Impact**: Can't track tasks in database yet
   - **Workaround**: LLM uses conversation context instead

2. **Token Tracking Limitation**: Claude Code can't access internal token counts
   - **Impact**: Can't warn about context overflow
   - **Workaround**: Time-based checkpoints instead

## üìã Session Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Test Handover Creation Flow
**Pre-requisites**:
- [ ] Verify orchestrate.py accepts correct command syntax
- [ ] Ensure handover-manager.py helper functions work

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Run `python orchestrate.py handover --summary info` to gather information
2. [ ] LLM creates comprehensive handover following template
3. [ ] Present to user for approval
4. [ ] Save using `echo "[content]" | python orchestrate.py handover --summary save`
5. [ ] Verify archive and new handover created correctly

**Potential Issues**:
- Command syntax might need adjustment ‚Üí Check orchestrate.py argument parser
- Save command might have pipe issues ‚Üí Test with file input first

### Task 2: Test Session Start
**Pre-requisites**:
- [ ] Handover successfully created and saved
- [ ] Session command implemented in orchestrate.py

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Run `python orchestrate.py session start`
2. [ ] Verify it reads and displays handover correctly
3. [ ] Check that all required documents are referenced
4. [ ] Confirm user can understand context from handover

### Task 3: Fix Database Schema (If Time Permits)
**Steps**:
1. [ ] Review `short-term-memory/schema.sql`
2. [ ] Create missing tables or fix column issues
3. [ ] Test database integration with handover system

## üîó Additional References

### Framework Documentation
- Python importlib for handling hyphenated module names
- SQLite for session state management

### Relevant Code
- `orchestrate.py:143-176` - Handover command handler
- `brain/handover-manager.py:44-66` - Information gathering function
- `brain/handover-manager.py:68-93` - Archive and save function

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test information gathering
cd claude-orchestrator && python orchestrate.py handover --summary info

# Test saving (with test content)
echo "# Test Handover" | python orchestrate.py handover --summary save

# Test session start
python orchestrate.py session start
```

## üí≠ Context & Decisions

### Recent Technical Decisions
**LLM-Driven Architecture**: Decided that LLM should create handover content, not Python
- **Rationale**: LLM has full session context, Python can only guess
- **Impact**: Handovers will be rich narratives, not sparse bullet points

**Helper Tools Pattern**: Python provides data, LLM provides intelligence
- **Rationale**: Best use of each system's strengths
- **Impact**: More flexible and comprehensive handovers

### Architectural Considerations
- Follow template structure for consistency
- Keep user in control with full visibility
- Prefer comprehensive over minimal documentation
- Use hyphenated names despite Python import challenges

## ‚ö° Quick Reference
```bash
# Current working directory
cd /home/klaus/game-projects/claude-orchestrate

# Run handover helper
cd claude-orchestrator && python orchestrate.py handover --summary info

# Save handover
echo "[content]" | python orchestrate.py handover --summary save
```

## üèÅ Session End Checklist

**Before ending session:**
- [ ] Ensure this handover is saved properly
- [ ] Verify previous handover was archived
- [ ] Check that all modified files are documented
- [ ] Confirm next steps are clear

**Commit Reminders**:
- Only commit when user explicitly requests
- Currently 11 uncommitted changes need attention
- Include session summary: "Redesigned handover system to be LLM-driven"

## üö® DO NOT SKIP MANDATORY READS

The mandatory documents contain critical information about:
- How the user wants to interact (CLAUDE.md)
- Project coding standards (kebab-case naming)
- Workflow rules that prevent problems
- Architectural decisions (LLM-driven, not Python-generated)

**Time invested in reading: 15-20 minutes**
**Time saved by reading: Multiple sessions**
