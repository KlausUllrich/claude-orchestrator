# Session Handover - 2025-08-09 21:30

## Session Summary
Worked on Claude Orchestrator session handover system design. Clarified architecture and how orchestration works through Claude commands, not separate processes.

## Completed (User Approved)
- ✅ Created tool-development workflow
- ✅ Built SQLite database schema  
- ✅ Clarified orchestration approach (commands in Claude, not separate terminal)
- ✅ Decided on implementation strategy

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Orchestration via Claude commands** - No separate terminal process
2. **Commands through orchestrate.py** - Central dispatcher (Option B chosen)
3. **Use existing session-end-manager.md** - For handover creation
4. **Each project has own orchestrator copy** - Self-contained, no sharing

## Known Issues
- Token tracking doesn't work in Claude Code (needs dedicated session)
- Context Guardian can't access Claude's internal tokens
- Commands exist as documentation only, not executable yet

## Next Session Goals

### Priority 1: Working Handover System
1. Create `brain/handover-manager.py` with:
   - `create_handover()` - generates handover document
   - `read_handover()` - reads last handover

2. Extend `orchestrate.py` with:
   - `handover` command
   - `session start` command  
   - `session end` command

3. Update `.claude/commands/`:
   - Make `/handover` actually execute Python
   - Make `/session-start` actually execute Python
   - Use orchestrate.py as dispatcher

4. Test complete flow:
   ```
   /session-start → read handover → work → /handover → create handover
   ```

### Priority 2: Task Tracking
- Create `short-term-memory/task-tracker.py`
- Add task commands to orchestrate.py
- Commands: `/task-add`, `/task-list`, `/task-complete`

### Priority 3: Database Cleanup
- Rename: session_state.db → session-context.db
- Create: task-queue.db
- Create: message-queue.db (for agents)

## TODOs for Future Sessions
- **Token Tracking**: Research Claude-Flow solution (dedicated session)
- **Long-term Memory**: Consider vector DB or knowledge graph
- **External Bridges**: YouTrack, Notebook LM, GitHub Issues
- **Configuration**: user.yaml, project.yaml settings
- **Validation**: Document checkers, rule validators
- **Enhancement**: Include core rules and doc index in session start

## Project Structure Reminder
```
my-game-project/
├── .claude/commands/        # Claude command definitions
├── claude-orchestrator/     # Complete orchestrator (self-contained)
├── Docs/Status/            # Handovers go here
└── .orchestrator/          # Project-specific state
```

## Important Notes
- Orchestrator works through Claude commands, not background process
- Each project has its own complete orchestrator copy
- Commands should go through orchestrate.py as central dispatcher
- Focus on getting basic handover working before adding complexity
