- `claude-orchestrator/short-term-memory/schema.sql` - Database schema
- Review test/demo files identified as needing attention

## Session Summary

Worked on implementing handover system, focusing on orchestrate.py

## Work State

### Completed This Session
- ‚úÖ Created handover-manager.py module

### Work in Progress (Continue Next Session)
- üîß `orchestrate.py`: Needs handover/session commands added

### Files Needing Attention
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `claude-orchestrator/short-term-memory/demo_db.py`: Test/demo file - verify if still needed

## Key Decisions Made
- (No key decisions recorded)

## Known Issues

‚ö†Ô∏è Database error: no such column: created_at


## Next Session Goals

### Continue Work in Progress:

### Files Needing Attention:
- claude-orchestrator/short-term-memory/demo_db.py: Test/demo file - verify if still needed

### From TODO - Immediate Priority:
- Create `brain/handover-manager.py` with create/read functions

## Git Safety Check

Branch: main (6 uncommitted changes - remember to commit before ending session)

*Note: Commit and push will be handled separately via `/end-session` command*

## Additional Context



## Important Reminders

- Orchestrator works through Claude commands, not background process
- Commands flow: User ‚Üí Claude ‚Üí orchestrate.py ‚Üí Python scripts
- Test simple implementations before adding complexity
- Check for uncommitted changes before ending work
