# Claude Orchestrate - Project Status

## ‚úÖ What We've Built

### Context Guardian (Working!)
A functional token monitor that:
- Estimates token usage in real-time
- Provides warnings at 70%, 80%, 90% capacity
- Creates checkpoints for session handover
- Has interactive mode for monitoring
- Persists state between sessions

### Vision Document
Comprehensive planning document covering:
- Core problems we're solving
- Rethinking documentation tiers
- Tool integration strategy
- Open questions for discussion
- Implementation phases

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Test with Real Session
```bash
# In one terminal, start the monitor
python3 context_guardian/monitor.py --watch

# In another terminal, use Claude normally
# Periodically paste your conversation into the monitor
# Use "add <text>" command to track tokens
```

### 2. Discussion Topics for Next Session

#### Documentation Tiers
Current 7-tier system problems:
- **Task tier** ‚Üí Should be in YouTrack/GitHub Issues?
- **Knowledge Base** ‚Üí Should use Vector DB or Notebook LM?
- **SystemSpec** ‚Üí Often outdated, should be code-as-spec?
- **Execution** ‚Üí Overlaps with Task tier

**Question**: Which tiers do you actually use and find valuable?

#### Bug Tracking Choice
Options:
1. **YouTrack** (MCP available)
   - Pros: Powerful, good API, MCP exists
   - Cons: Complex, another tool to manage
   
2. **GitHub Issues**
   - Pros: Simple, integrated with code
   - Cons: Limited features for complex tracking
   
3. **Custom SQLite**
   - Pros: Full control, integrated
   - Cons: Need to build everything

**Question**: Do you already use YouTrack? What's your preference?

#### Knowledge Management
Options:
1. **Notebook LM**
   - Can it maintain project knowledge?
   - API access available?
   
2. **Local Vector DB** (ChromaDB)
   - Privacy, full control
   - Need to build search interface
   
3. **Mem0 MCP**
   - Ready-made solution
   - But is it flexible enough?

**Question**: Have you used Notebook LM? What are your thoughts?

## üöÄ Proposed Development Path

### Week 1: Foundation & Context Management
- [x] Create vision document
- [x] Build Context Guardian
- [ ] Import hook system from claude-template
- [ ] Create SQLite state management
- [ ] Test with real Claude sessions

### Week 2: Rule System
- [ ] Extract your best rules from existing projects
- [ ] Build micro-rule architecture
- [ ] Create rule injection hooks
- [ ] Test drift detection

### Week 3: Knowledge Integration
- [ ] Evaluate YouTrack MCP
- [ ] Test vector search options
- [ ] Build knowledge extraction
- [ ] Create search interface

### Week 4: Multi-Agent Exploration
- [ ] Test parallel Claude Code sessions
- [ ] Build message queue
- [ ] Create documentation agent
- [ ] Test bug hunter mode

## üí° Key Insights from Our Discussion

1. **You need a working system NOW** - Not another months-long tool search
2. **Context overflow is the #1 problem** - Everything else is secondary
3. **Your existing work is valuable** - Build on claude-template hooks, Unity MCP
4. **Documentation tiers need rethinking** - Not all are equally useful
5. **Transparency is critical** - You need to understand what's happening

## üìù Questions for You

1. **Documentation**: Which of your 7 tiers actually help vs. create overhead?
2. **Bug Tracking**: Do you already use YouTrack or prefer GitHub Issues?
3. **Knowledge Base**: Interested in Notebook LM integration?
4. **Priority**: After context management, what's most painful?
5. **Workflow**: How do you typically use Claude? (Desktop, Web, CLI?)

## üîÑ How to Continue

### Option 1: Refine Context Guardian
- Add Claude API integration for automatic tracking
- Build browser extension for claude.ai
- Create automatic handover generation

### Option 2: Start Rule System
- Import your best rules
- Build injection mechanism
- Test with real projects

### Option 3: Explore Knowledge Tools
- Test YouTrack MCP
- Try Notebook LM API
- Evaluate vector databases

## Session Summary

We've created a foundation for "claude-orchestrate":
- ‚úÖ Clear vision document with open questions
- ‚úÖ Working Context Guardian prototype
- ‚úÖ Project structure for growth
- ‚úÖ Identified key decisions needed

The Context Guardian alone should help prevent lost work from context overflow.

Next session we should:
1. Test Context Guardian with your real work
2. Decide on documentation tier strategy
3. Choose bug tracking approach
4. Begin building the most painful missing piece

**The goal**: Get you back to game development with better tools, not endless tool building!
