# Session Handover - 2025-08-09 21:30

## üìö REQUIRED READING (Prevent Confusion)

**Read these IN ORDER before starting work:**

1. **This handover document** - Complete reading before any work
2. **`docs/status/todo.md`** - Full TODO list is NOW HERE, same folder as handover! (~240 lines)
3. **`QUICK-REFERENCE.md`** - Simple overview of how things work (~70 lines) 
4. **`docs/design/vision.md`** - Understand project goals and approach (~315 lines)
5. **`docs/technical/architecture.md`** - CRITICAL: How components fit together (~248 lines)
6. **`claude-orchestrator/brain/rules/README.md`** - How rules system works (~71 lines)
7. **`docs/technical/known-limitations.md`** - What doesn't work and why (~69 lines)
8. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Core interaction rules (~46 lines)

**Key Understanding Points:**
- ‚ùó Orchestrator works through Claude commands, NOT a separate terminal
- ‚ùó Commands execute Python scripts via orchestrate.py
- ‚ùó Each project has its own complete orchestrator copy
- ‚ùó Token tracking doesn't work in Claude Code (known limitation)
- ‚ùó Resource-library = templates, .claude/ = active components

**Check Understanding:**
Before starting, confirm you understand:
- [ ] How commands flow: User ‚Üí Claude ‚Üí orchestrate.py ‚Üí Python scripts
- [ ] Where handovers are stored: `docs/status/` (project docs)
- [ ] Where databases live: `claude-orchestrator/short-term-memory/`
- [ ] What works vs what's TODO

## Session Summary
Worked on Claude Orchestrator session handover system design. Clarified architecture and how orchestration works through Claude commands, not separate processes.

## Completed (User Approved)
- ‚úÖ Created tool-development workflow (files exist, not integrated)
- ‚úÖ Built SQLite database schema (works standalone)
- ‚úÖ Clarified orchestration approach (commands in Claude, not separate terminal)
- ‚úÖ Decided on implementation strategy (orchestrate.py as dispatcher)
- ‚úÖ Created documentation to prevent confusion (QUICK-REFERENCE.md)
- ‚úÖ Organized comprehensive TODO list (TODO-COMPLETE.md)

## What Was Planned But NOT Done
- ‚ùå Making commands actually executable (still just documentation)
- ‚ùå Connecting components together (all standalone)
- ‚ùå Testing the handover flow (nothing to test yet)
- ‚ùå Task tracker implementation (schema exists, no code)
- ‚ùå Renaming files to kebab-case (rule_enforcer.py still wrong name)

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Orchestration via Claude commands** - No separate terminal process
2. **Commands through orchestrate.py** - Central dispatcher (Option B chosen)
3. **Use existing session-end-manager.md** - For handover creation
4. **Each project has own orchestrator copy** - Self-contained, no sharing

## Known Issues
- Token tracking doesn't work in Claude Code (needs dedicated session)
- Context Guardian can't access Claude's internal tokens
- Commands exist as documentation only, not executable yet

## Next Session Goals

### üéØ SINGLE FOCUS: Make Commands Work
**Do THIS before anything else:**

1. Create `brain/handover-manager.py`:
```python
def create_handover():
    # Get data from session-context.db
    # Prompt for summary
    # Create markdown file
    # Save to docs/status/

def read_handover():
    # Read handover-next.md
    # Display contents
```

2. Extend `orchestrate.py`:
```python
# Add these commands:
elif args.command == "handover":
    # Call handover-manager.create_handover()
elif args.command == "session":
    if args.action == "start":
        # Call handover-manager.read_handover()
```

3. Make commands executable:
- Update `.claude/commands/handover.md` to actually run Python
- Update `.claude/commands/session-start.md` to actually run Python

4. Test the basic loop:
```
/session-start ‚Üí reads handover ‚Üí work ‚Üí /handover ‚Üí creates handover
```

**ONLY after this works, move to Priority 2 and 3**

### Priority 2: Task Tracking
- Create `short-term-memory/task-tracker.py`
- Add task commands to orchestrate.py
- Commands: `/task-add`, `/task-list`, `/task-complete`

### Priority 3: Database Cleanup
- Rename: session_state.db ‚Üí session-context.db
- Create: task-queue.db
- Create: message-queue.db (for agents)

## TODOs for Future Sessions

**üìå See `docs/status/todo.md` for complete list (240 lines) - RIGHT HERE in status folder**

### Quick Summary of Major TODOs:
- **Token Tracking**: Research Claude-Flow solution (dedicated session)
- **Session Handover Enhancement**: Include rules, docs-index, workflow configs
- **Validation System**: Doc checkers, rule validators, contradiction detector
- **Long-term Memory**: Vector DB or knowledge graph consideration
- **External Bridges**: YouTrack, Notebook LM, GitHub Issues
- **Configuration**: user.yaml, project.yaml settings
- **Multi-Agent**: Message queue, coordination protocols
- **Resource Library**: Populate with templates (hooks, agents, documents)

### What We Discussed But Didn't Implement:
- Rename `rule_enforcer.py` ‚Üí `rule-engine.py` (kebab-case consistency)
- Create `brain/conductor.py` for main orchestration
- Emergency handover for context overflow
- Workflow phases.yaml and checks.yaml
- Hook activation through orchestrate.py
- Session metrics tracking
- Documentation validation tools
- Agent communication via message-queue.db

## Project Structure Reminder
```
my-game-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/commands/        # Claude command definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude-orchestrator/     # Complete orchestrator (self-contained)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Docs/Status/            # Handovers go here
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .orchestrator/          # Project-specific state
```

## Important Notes
- Orchestrator works through Claude commands, not background process
- Each project has its own complete orchestrator copy
- Commands should go through orchestrate.py as central dispatcher
- Focus on getting basic handover working before adding complexity

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING - Avoid This Session's Mistakes

**The Big Confusion:** I spent hours thinking the orchestrator needed a separate terminal process or tmux session. **IT DOESN'T!**

**The Reality:**
- User types command in Claude Code (like `/handover`)
- Claude runs Python script (via `orchestrate.py`)
- Script updates files/databases
- Result shown to user
- **That's it. No daemon, no monitoring, no separate process.**

**Why the confusion happened:**
- Didn't read architecture.md first
- Made assumptions instead of checking existing code
- Overthought the "orchestration" concept
- Ignored existing structures and agents

**How to avoid this:**
1. READ the required documents FIRST
2. CHECK what exists before creating
3. TEST simple before complex
4. ASK if unsure about architecture

**DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Assume token tracking works in Claude Code (it doesn't)
- ‚ùå Create a separate terminal/tmux monitoring process
- ‚ùå Remove or ignore existing components (agents, workflows, etc.)
- ‚ùå Make design decisions without reading architecture.md
- ‚ùå Confuse resource-library (templates) with .claude/ (active)
- ‚ùå Create complex solutions before basic features work

**ALWAYS:**
- ‚úÖ Read all required documents before starting
- ‚úÖ Check what already exists before creating new files
- ‚úÖ Use existing agents and structures
- ‚úÖ Test basic functionality before adding features
- ‚úÖ Get user approval for major decisions
- ‚úÖ Keep the full architecture intact
