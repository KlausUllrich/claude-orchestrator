# Agent 1 - Communication Protocol

You are Agent 1. You have full Claude tool access.

## Communication Channels:
- Your outputs: outputs/
- Agent 2's outputs: ../agent2/outputs/
- Agent 3's outputs: ../agent3/outputs/

## How to communicate with Agent 2:
- Write requests to: ../agent2/inputs/request_from_agent1.txt
- Read responses from: ../agent2/outputs/response_to_agent1.txt

## Available Tools:
You have full access to Read, Write, Bash, and all other Claude tools.

## Waiting for your task...
You will be given a specific task. Use the other agents as needed to complete it.
EOF

# Agent 2: Only knows how to communicate
cat > "$BASE_DIR/agent2/protocol.md" << 'EOF'
# Agent 2 - Communication Protocol

You are Agent 2. You have full Claude tool access.

## Communication Channels:
- Your inputs: inputs/
- Your outputs: outputs/
- Agent 1's outputs: ../agent1/outputs/
- Agent 3's outputs: ../agent3/outputs/

## Protocol:
- Monitor inputs/ for requests
- When you receive a request from Agent 1 (inputs/request_from_agent1.txt):
  - Read and understand it
  - If it requires Agent 3, write to: ../agent3/inputs/request_from_agent2.txt
  - Read Agent 3's response from: ../agent3/outputs/response_to_agent2.txt
  - Report back to Agent 1 via: outputs/response_to_agent1.txt

## Available Tools:
You have full access to Read, Write, Bash, and all other Claude tools.

## Status:
Waiting for requests... Monitor your inputs/ directory.
EOF

# Agent 3: Only knows how to communicate
cat > "$BASE_DIR/agent3/protocol.md" << 'EOF'
# Agent 3 - Communication Protocol

You are Agent 3. You have full Claude tool access.

## Communication Channels:
- Your inputs: inputs/
- Your outputs: outputs/

## Protocol:
- Monitor inputs/ for requests
- When you receive a request from Agent 2 (inputs/request_from_agent2.txt):
  - Read and understand it
  - Process the request
  - Write response to: outputs/response_to_agent2.txt

## Available Tools:
You have full access to Read, Write, Bash, and all other Claude tools.

## Status:
Waiting for requests... Monitor your inputs/ directory.
EOF

# Create the TASK file only for Agent 1
cat > "$BASE_DIR/agent1/TASK.md" << 'EOF'
# TASK FOR AGENT 1 ONLY

## Your Mission:
Get a random number from Agent 3 through Agent 2, then double it.

## Steps:
1. Ask Agent 2 to get a random number from Agent 3
2. Wait for Agent 2's response
3. Double the number
4. Output: "FINAL_RESULT: Original was [X], doubled is [2X]"

## Remember:
- Use the communication protocol described in protocol.md
- Agent 2 doesn't know what to do until you tell them
- Agent 3 doesn't know what to do until Agent 2 tells them

Begin by writing a request to Agent 2.
