# Documentation Placement Rules
#
# This file defines WHERE different types of documentation go.
# It's the single source of truth for doc organization.
# All agents and hooks read these rules to decide where to write.

  Rules for determining where documentation should be placed.
  Separates permanent project knowledge from transient agent feedback.
  
  KEY PRINCIPLE: 
  - Permanent knowledge → docs/ (git tracked)
  - Temporary reports → agent-feedback/ (git ignored)
  - Tool state → .orchestrator/ (git ignored)

rules:
  - Permanent documentation goes in Docs/
  - Transient agent reports go in agent-feedback/
  - Operational data goes in .orchestrator/
  - Tool documentation stays in claude-orchestrator/

placement:
  # Permanent documentation
  vision: Docs/Design/
  architecture: Docs/Technical/
  specification: Docs/Technical/
  api: Docs/Technical/
  handbook: Docs/Workflow/
  process: Docs/Workflow/
  todo: Docs/Workflow/
  
  # Session documentation
  handover: Docs/Status/
  milestone: Docs/Status/
  
  # Transient reports (agent-feedback/)
  report: agent-feedback/session-{date}/
  findings: agent-feedback/session-{date}/
  analysis: agent-feedback/session-{date}/
  status-update: agent-feedback/session-{date}/
  reorganization: agent-feedback/session-{date}/
  
  # Operational data
  state: .orchestrator/state/
  memory: .orchestrator/memory/
  checkpoint: .orchestrator/state/checkpoints/
