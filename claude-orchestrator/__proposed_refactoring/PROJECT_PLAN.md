# Project Plan: Phased Implementation with Proof Requirements

## Overview

This plan ensures we **prove each critical component works** before refactoring. We maintain the current working system while developing and testing new components in isolation.

## Phase 0: Critical Proofs (Weeks 1-2)

### 0.1 Autonomous Agent Execution (BLOCKER - Must Solve First)

**The Problem:** Main agent blocks while sub-agents run, making true parallelization impossible.

**Proof Required:**
```python
# We need to prove this works:
Main Agent: launch_sub_agent("researcher", "research task")
Main Agent: continue_with_own_work()  # CAN THIS HAPPEN?
# Later...
Main Agent: results = check_sub_agent_results()  # Non-blocking check
```

**Tests to Run:**
1. **Background Process Test**
   - Launch Python script as subprocess
   - Use files for communication
   - Test if main can continue

2. **MCP Async Test**
   - Create minimal async MCP server
   - Test non-blocking operations
   - Measure latency

3. **File Watcher Test**
   - Sub-agents write to completion files
   - Main polls for completion
   - Test detection speed

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Main agent continues working while sub-agent runs
- [ ] Results retrievable without blocking
- [ ] Acceptable performance (<1s overhead)

### 0.2 Guardian Veto Mechanism

**Proof Required:**
```python
# Can Guardian actually block actions?
Main Agent: Edit("file.py", ...)
Guardian: VETO - "Must Read first"
Main Agent: [Blocked, must comply]
```

**Tests to Run:**
1. **Hook Interception Test**
   - Intercept tool calls before execution
   - Raise blocking exception
   - Verify agent cannot proceed

2. **Override Prevention Test**
   - Try to bypass Guardian
   - Ensure veto cannot be caught/ignored
   - Test enforcement reliability

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Guardian can block tool execution
- [ ] Veto cannot be overridden
- [ ] Clear error messages to agent

### 0.3 Real-Time Dashboard

**Proof Required:**
- WebSocket streaming works
- Updates are fast enough
- Browser can handle update rate

**Tests to Run:**
1. **WebSocket Performance Test**
   - Stream 100 updates/second
   - Measure browser performance
   - Test connection stability

2. **Translation Speed Test**
   - Translator agent keeping up?
   - Batching needed?
   - Priority system required?

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Dashboard updates in <1 second
- [ ] Handles 10+ agents simultaneously
- [ ] Human-readable translations work

## Phase 1: Memory Systems (Weeks 3-4)

### 1.1 Short-Term Memory (SQLite)

**Components to Build:**
- session_state.db schema
- message_queue.db for agents
- hard_facts.db for constants

**Tests Required:**
- [ ] Agents can share state via SQLite
- [ ] Message passing works reliably
- [ ] No race conditions with parallel access

### 1.2 Token Estimation System

**Components to Build:**
- Token estimator based on operations
- Checkpoint trigger system
- Usage visualization

**Tests Required:**
- [ ] Estimation within 20% of actual
- [ ] Checkpoint warnings work
- [ ] Dashboard displays usage

### 1.3 Long-Term Memory (Vector DB)

**Components to Build:**
- Vector DB setup (ChromaDB initially)
- Embedding creation
- Semantic search interface

**Tests Required:**
- [ ] Semantic search returns relevant results
- [ ] Performance acceptable (<2s queries)
- [ ] Memory grows managably

## Phase 2: Integration Tests (Weeks 5-6)

### 2.1 Guardian + Dashboard Integration

**Test Scenario:**
```
1. Main agent attempts violation
2. Guardian blocks it
3. Dashboard shows intervention
4. User sees what happened
5. Agent corrects and proceeds
```

### 2.2 Memory + Agent Integration

**Test Scenario:**
```
1. Agent queries long-term memory
2. Finds relevant pattern
3. Applies pattern
4. Stores decision
5. Other agents access decision
```

### 2.3 Parallel + Guardian Integration

**Test Scenario:**
```
1. Launch 3 sub-agents
2. Guardian monitors all
3. One agent violates rule
4. Guardian blocks that agent only
5. Others continue
```

## Phase 3: Gradual Migration (Weeks 7-8)

### 3.1 Add to Current System

**Safe Additions:**
1. Add Guardian as optional monitor
2. Add dashboard for visibility
3. Add token estimator
4. Keep existing workflows

### 3.2 Parallel Testing

**Run Both Systems:**
- Current orchestrator for production
- New system for testing
- Compare results
- Identify issues

### 3.3 Component Replacement

**Replace One at a Time:**
1. Replace token tracking first (low risk)
2. Replace monitoring (added value)
3. Replace task coordination (carefully)
4. Replace workflows (gradually)

## Phase 4: External Integrations (Weeks 9-10)

### 4.1 YouTrack Integration

**Build:**
- YouTrack MCP bridge
- Issue creation from Guardian
- Bug pattern extraction

**Test:**
- [ ] Issues created correctly
- [ ] Context preserved
- [ ] Updates work

### 4.2 Knowledge Tools

**Build:**
- Notebook LM bridge (if API available)
- GitHub Issues fallback
- Unity MCP enhancement

## Testing Requirements by Component

### Autonomous Execution Tests

```python
# test_autonomous_execution.py
def test_main_continues_while_sub_runs():
    """Critical test - must pass"""
    # Launch sub-agent
    # Verify main can continue
    # Verify results retrievable
    
def test_multiple_sub_agents():
    """Test parallel execution"""
    # Launch 5 sub-agents
    # Verify all run simultaneously
    # Verify no blocking
    
def test_result_collection():
    """Test async result gathering"""
    # Launch agents with different completion times
    # Collect results as they complete
    # Verify no waiting
```

### Guardian Tests

```python
# test_guardian_enforcement.py
def test_veto_blocks_execution():
    """Guardian can stop actions"""
    # Attempt violation
    # Verify blocked
    # Verify cannot proceed
    
def test_veto_cannot_be_overridden():
    """Veto is absolute"""
    # Try to catch exception
    # Try to ignore veto
    # Verify still blocked
    
def test_guardian_performance():
    """Guardian doesn't slow system"""
    # Measure overhead
    # Must be <100ms per action
```

### Dashboard Tests

```python
# test_dashboard_updates.py
def test_realtime_updates():
    """Updates appear quickly"""
    # Send update
    # Measure time to display
    # Must be <1 second
    
def test_translation_accuracy():
    """Human readable output"""
    # Send technical update
    # Verify translation
    # Check readability
```

### Memory Tests

```python
# test_memory_systems.py
def test_agent_communication():
    """Agents share state"""
    # Agent 1 stores data
    # Agent 2 retrieves it
    # Verify consistency
    
def test_semantic_search():
    """Find relevant knowledge"""
    # Store patterns
    # Search with query
    # Verify relevance
```

## Risk Management

### Critical Risks

1. **Autonomous Execution Fails**
   - Impact: Entire architecture blocked
   - Mitigation: Have 3 approaches to test
   - Fallback: Enhanced sequential with status

2. **Guardian Too Restrictive**
   - Impact: Productivity drops
   - Mitigation: Configurable rules
   - Fallback: Warning-only mode

3. **Dashboard Overwhelming**
   - Impact: Information overload
   - Mitigation: Filtering and priorities
   - Fallback: Summary view only

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Test in Isolation:** Each component separately
- **Maintain Current System:** No breaking changes
- **Incremental Migration:** One piece at a time
- **User Control:** Can disable any component

## Success Criteria

### Go/No-Go Decision Points

**After Phase 0:**
- [ ] Autonomous execution proven? → Go
- [ ] Guardian enforcement works? → Go  
- [ ] Dashboard performs well? → Go
- If any fail → Stop and reassess

**After Phase 1:**
- [ ] Memory systems reliable? → Go
- [ ] Token tracking useful? → Go
- If fail → Continue without these features

**After Phase 2:**
- [ ] Integration successful? → Go
- [ ] No performance degradation? → Go
- If fail → Return to current system
