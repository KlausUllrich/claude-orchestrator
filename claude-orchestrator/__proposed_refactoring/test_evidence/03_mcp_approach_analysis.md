# Test Results: MCP Server Approach

## Test Information
- **Date**: 2025-08-12
- **Time**: 15:24
- **Tester**: Claude
- **Approach**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for parallel execution

## MCP Configuration Status

### Configuration Discovered
✅ **Project has `.mcp.json` configured**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "parallel-test": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/test_mcp_approach.py", "--server"],
      "env": {"PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"}
    }
  }
}
```

### How MCP Works in Claude Code
1. **Three Scopes**: local, project, user
2. **Project scope**: Shared via `.mcp.json` in project root
3. **Transport methods**: stdio, SSE, HTTP
4. **Priority**: local > project > user

### MCP Server Implementation
The test server implements:
- `launch_background_task`: Launch tasks without blocking
- `check_task_status`: Query task status
- `queue_task`: Queue for batch execution
- `execute_batch`: Execute all queued tasks in parallel

## Technical Analysis

### Architecture
```
Claude → MCP Tool Call → MCP Server → subprocess.Popen → Scripts
   ↓          ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
[WAITING]  [REQUEST]    [PROCESSING]   [LAUNCHING]    [RUNNING]
```

### Key Question: Does Claude Block?
**UNKNOWN WITHOUT LIVE TEST**

Theory suggests:
- MCP tools are still Claude tools (likely synchronous)
- Server can return immediately after launching
- But Claude still waits for tool response
- Similar blocking to Task tool expected

### Advantages Over Task Tool
1. **Server persists** across calls
2. **Stateful tracking** of tasks
3. **Custom protocols** possible
4. **Better error handling**
5. **Database integration** for history

### Disadvantages
1. **Complex setup** required
2. **Server process** must be running
3. **Still likely blocks** Claude
4. **Debugging harder** than simple scripts
5. **More moving parts**

## Comparison to Other Approaches

| Aspect | MCP Server | File Signaling | run_in_background | Task Tool |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Setup Complexity | ❌ High | ⚠️ Medium | ✅ Simple | ⚠️ Medium |
| Claude Autonomy | ❓ Unknown | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ❌ None |
| Persistence | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Files | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Monitoring | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Files | ⚠️ BashOutput | ❌ Limited |
| Scalability | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Limited |
| Debugging | ❌ Hard | ✅ Easy | ✅ Easy | ⚠️ Medium |

## Why Full Test Wasn't Completed

### Issue: MCP Tool Not Available
Despite having `.mcp.json` configured:
- No MCP tools appear in Claude's tool list
- Cannot call the configured server
- Configuration might need activation

### Possible Reasons
1. MCP servers need explicit activation via CLI
2. Session needs restart after configuration
3. Transport type (stdio) might need different setup
4. Server needs to be running before session

### What Was Tested
✅ Server implementation works locally
✅ Can launch background tasks
✅ Can track task status
✅ Database logging functional
✅ Batch execution works

### What Couldn't Be Tested
❌ Claude calling MCP tools
❌ Blocking behavior verification
❌ Real-world performance
❌ Error handling from Claude
❌ Session persistence

## Theoretical Assessment

### Likely Behavior
Based on MCP documentation and server design:

1. **Probable Blocking**: MCP tools likely block like other tools
2. **Fast Returns**: Server can return quickly after launching
3. **Stateful Advantage**: Server maintains task history
4. **Complex Coordination**: Could implement sophisticated patterns

### When MCP Makes Sense
✅ Need persistent state across calls
✅ Complex coordination logic
✅ Integration with external systems
✅ Shared team resources
❌ Simple parallel execution
❌ Quick prototypes

## Conclusions

### Primary Finding
**MCP APPROACH REQUIRES FURTHER INVESTIGATION**

Without ability to test actual Claude-MCP interaction:
- Cannot confirm blocking behavior
- Cannot measure performance
- Cannot verify autonomy

### Secondary Findings
1. **Setup is complex** compared to alternatives
2. **Server provides persistence** advantage
3. **Protocol is flexible** for custom needs
4. **Debugging is harder** than simple approaches

### Recommendation
**For Guardian Architecture: NOT RECOMMENDED**

Reasons:
1. Too complex for the need
2. Likely still blocks Claude
3. File signaling + run_in_background simpler
4. Harder to debug and maintain

### Best Use Cases
✅ Cross-project shared resources
✅ Integration with external APIs
✅ Stateful service requirements
✅ Team collaboration tools
❌ Simple parallelization
❌ Project-specific orchestration

## Next Steps

To properly test MCP:
1. Run `claude mcp add parallel-test --scope project python /path/to/server --server`
2. Restart Claude session
3. Check for MCP tools availability
4. Test blocking behavior
5. Measure performance

## Summary Comparison Table

| Approach | Complexity | Autonomy | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| run_in_background | ✅ Simple | ✅ Full | Quick tasks, simple parallel |
| File Signaling | ⚠️ Medium | ✅ Full | Dependencies, coordination |
| Task Tool | ⚠️ Medium | ❌ None | Not recommended |
| MCP Server | ❌ Complex | ❓ Unknown | External integration |

## Final Verdict
**MCP is over-engineering for Guardian architecture**. The combination of `run_in_background` + file signaling provides everything needed with less complexity.

**Test Status**: INCOMPLETE (configuration issues)
**Result**: NOT RECOMMENDED for Guardian use case
**Key Finding**: Complexity exceeds benefits for orchestration
