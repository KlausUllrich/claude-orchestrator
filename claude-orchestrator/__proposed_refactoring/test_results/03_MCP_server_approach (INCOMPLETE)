# Test Results: MCP Server Approach (INCOMPLETE)

  ## Test Information
  - **Date**: 2025-08-11
  - **Time**: 21:40-21:50
  - **Tester**: Claude
  - **Approach**: MCP Server for parallel task execution
  - **Status**: INCOMPLETE - Configuration issues prevented testing

  ## Test Setup Attempted
  - Created test MCP server in `test_mcp_approach.py`
  - Server provides tools for:
    - `launch_background_task` - Launch tasks in background
    - `check_task_status` - Check task status
    - `queue_task` - Queue tasks
    - `execute_batch` - Execute queued tasks in parallel
  - Created test agents (alpha.py, beta.py, gamma.py)

  ## Configuration Issues Encountered

  ### What Was Tried
  1. Initially configured in wrong file: `/home/klaus/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Claude Desktop)
  2. Then tried `.mcp.json` in project root (incorrect name)
  3. Should be `.claude.json` according to user (not documented in Claude Code docs)

  ### Current Status
  - **BLOCKED**: MCP server not recognized by Claude Code
  - Configuration file location/format unclear
  - `/mcp` command returns "No MCP servers configured"

  ## What We Wanted to Test

  ### Key Questions (UNANSWERED)
  1. Do MCP tool calls block Claude or return immediately?
  2. Can Claude continue working while MCP server processes tasks?
  3. Is there better control than run_in_background?
  4. Can MCP servers provide true async behavior?

  ### Test Plan (NOT EXECUTED)
  1. Launch multiple agents via MCP tools
  2. Check if Claude blocks during MCP calls
  3. Monitor agent progress while Claude works
  4. Compare to Task tool and run_in_background approaches

  ## Files Created for This Test
  - `__proposed_refactoring/tests/test_mcp_approach.py` - MCP server implementation
  - `.orchestrate/tests/mcp/agents/` - Test agent scripts
  - `.mcp.json` (incorrect) -> renamed to `.claude.json` by user

  ## Uncertainties for Future Sessions

  ### Configuration Questions
  1. Correct configuration file: `.claude.json` or something else?
  2. Correct format for Claude Code MCP servers?
  3. Does Claude Code support local stdio MCP servers?
  4. Is there a different setup process than Claude Desktop?

  ### Technical Questions (Still Unknown)
  1. Are MCP tool calls synchronous or asynchronous?
  2. Can MCP servers provide fire-and-forget semantics?
  3. What's the overhead of MCP protocol vs direct execution?
  4. Can MCP servers maintain state between calls?

  ## Recommendation

  **DEFER MCP TESTING** until configuration is clarified.

  The MCP approach may offer advantages but cannot be tested without proper configuration. Key potential benefits if it works:
  - Centralized task management
  - Stateful server can track tasks
  - Potentially async if MCP protocol supports it
  - Better abstraction than raw subprocess calls

  However, based on other tool behaviors:
  - Likely that MCP tools also block Claude
  - All Claude tools appear to be synchronous
  - No evidence of true async capabilities

  ## Next Steps
  1. Research correct MCP configuration for Claude Code
  2. Test file-based signaling approach (can proceed now)
  3. Return to MCP testing if configuration resolved
  4. Document final comparison of all approaches
