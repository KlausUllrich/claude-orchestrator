# Simple Parallel Execution Solutions for Claude Orchestrate

## The Problem (Simplified)
Claude Code executes tasks sequentially when given one at a time. To get parallel execution, you MUST provide ALL Task commands in a SINGLE message.

## Three Simple Solutions (No claude-flow needed)

### Solution 1: Simple Parallel Coordinator (~270 lines)
**File:** `simple_parallel_coordinator.py`

A standalone Python script with SQLite backend that:
- Queues tasks in a database
- Generates batch commands for Claude
- No dependencies except SQLite
- Works immediately

**Usage:**
```python
from simple_parallel_coordinator import SimpleParallelCoordinator

coord = SimpleParallelCoordinator()
coord.queue_task("researcher", "Research Unity optimizations")
coord.queue_task("coder", "Implement pooling system")
coord.queue_task("tester", "Create benchmarks")

batch_id = coord.create_batch()
commands = coord.get_batch_commands(batch_id)
print(commands)  # Copy ALL commands to Claude in ONE message
```

### Solution 2: Hook-Based Integration (~295 lines)
**File:** `parallel_task_hook.py`

Integrates with your existing claude-template hook system:
- Auto-batches tasks after threshold
- SQLite message queue for agent communication
- Fits your vision document perfectly

**Integration with your hooks:**
```python
from parallel_task_hook import SimpleOrchestrator

orchestrator = SimpleOrchestrator()

# Queue through hooks
orchestrator.queue_parallel_task("researcher", "Research task")
orchestrator.queue_parallel_task("coder", "Code task")

# Auto-batches at threshold, or force:
commands = orchestrator.execute_parallel_batch()
```

### Solution 3: Minimal MCP Server (~225 lines)
**File:** `minimal_parallel_mcp.py`

Bare-bones MCP server with just TWO tools:
- `queue_parallel_task` - Add to batch
- `execute_parallel_batch` - Run all in parallel

**Setup:**
```bash
# Test it first
python3 minimal_parallel_mcp.py --test

# Get config for Claude Desktop
python3 minimal_parallel_mcp.py --config

# Add to ~/.claude/mcp_config.json
```

## Why These Work

All three solutions follow the same principle:
1. **Collect** tasks instead of executing immediately
2. **Batch** them into a single command block
3. **Execute** all Task commands in ONE message to Claude

## The Key Pattern

```python
# ❌ WRONG - Sequential execution
Message 1: Task("Agent 1: Do something")
Message 2: Task("Agent 2: Do something else")

# ✅ CORRECT - Parallel execution  
Single Message:
Task("Agent 1: Do something")
Task("Agent 2: Do something else")
Task("Agent 3: Do another thing")
```

## Which Solution to Choose?

### Use Simple Coordinator if:
- You want something working NOW
- You're comfortable with command-line tools
- You don't need hook integration

### Use Hook-Based if:
- You're building claude-orchestrate
- You have existing hook infrastructure
- You want automatic batching

### Use Minimal MCP if:
- You want proper Claude Desktop integration
- You prefer the MCP tool interface
- You might expand to more tools later

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Test parallel execution works:**
```bash
python3 test_parallel_execution.py
# Follow instructions to verify parallel execution
```

2. **Try the simple coordinator:**
```bash
python3 simple_parallel_coordinator.py
# Copy the generated Task commands
# Paste ALL into Claude Code at once
```

3. **If it works, choose your solution and integrate**

## Game Dev Focus

These solutions are designed for YOUR needs:
- No web development complexity
- No massive dependencies
- SQLite for reliability
- Clear, debuggable Python code
- Works with Unity projects
- Fits your vision document

## Integration with Claude Orchestrate

Your vision mentions:
- **Multi-Agent Coordinator** ✓ All three solutions provide this
- **SQLite message queue** ✓ Implemented in hook solution  
- **Python hooks** ✓ Hook-based solution fits perfectly
- **Simple focused tools** ✓ No bloat, just parallel execution

## The Core Insight

Claude Code CAN do parallel execution. It just needs proper batching. These simple tools give you that batching without the complexity of claude-flow.
