# Project Progress Check Task

## üöÄ Task Start Instructions

### For LLM Execution
**Read in this order:**
1. This entire task document
2. [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) - User interaction preferences
3. [EssentialWorkflowRules.md](../Rules/EssentialWorkflowRules.md) - Core workflow rules
4. [ProjectProgress.md](../../Docs/Status/ProjectProgress.md) - Current progress claims

## üìã Task Definition

### Purpose
Verify that ProjectProgress.md and related progress tracking accurately reflects the current implementation state, ensuring stakeholders have reliable project status information.

### Scope
Check all progress-related documentation against:
1. Actual code implementation
2. Feature completion states
3. Task list accuracy
4. Milestone achievements
5. Timeline realism

### Exclusions
**Skip checking:**
- `/Archive/` directories
- `/old/` directories
- Experimental branches
- Third-party code

## üîç Verification Checklist

### 1. Feature Implementation Status
- [ ] Each listed feature has accurate completion percentage
- [ ] Implementation status matches actual code in `/Source/`
- [ ] "Completed" features have working implementation
- [ ] "In Progress" features show partial implementation
- [ ] "Planned" features have no implementation yet

### 2. Code-to-Documentation Sync
- [ ] For each feature marked "Implemented":
  - Corresponding code exists in `/Source/`
  - Core functionality works
  - No major TODOs in implementation
- [ ] For "In Progress" features:
  - Partial implementation exists
  - Clear indication of what remains
  - Reasonable estimate to completion

### 3. Progress Percentages Validation
- [ ] Count actual vs planned components
- [ ] Verify percentage calculations
- [ ] Check for stale percentages (unchanged for weeks)
- [ ] Ensure no feature stuck at 90%+ for long

### 4. Task Lists Accuracy
- [ ] TODO items match actual work needed
- [ ] Completed tasks marked with [x]
- [ ] No duplicate or conflicting tasks
- [ ] Tasks align with design documents
- [ ] Priority levels make sense

### 5. Milestone and Version Tracking
- [ ] Current version number is accurate
- [ ] Milestone progress percentages calculated correctly
- [ ] Completed milestones marked appropriately
- [ ] Next milestone goals clear and achievable

### 6. Timeline and Estimates
- [ ] Last updated date is current
- [ ] Estimated completion dates realistic
- [ ] Historical progress preserved
- [ ] Velocity trends reasonable

### 7. Dependencies and Blockers
- [ ] Blocked features clearly marked with reasons
- [ ] Dependencies between features documented
- [ ] External dependencies tracked
- [ ] Blocker resolution plans exist

## üîé How to Check

### Step 1: Gather Current State
```bash
# List all implemented features by finding main game files
find /Source -name "*.lua" -type f | grep -E "(game|core|ui)" | sort

# Count feature-related files
find /Source -type f -name "*.lua" | wc -l

# Check for TODO/FIXME comments
rg "TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX" /Source --type lua
```

### Step 2: Map Features to Code
For each feature in ProjectProgress.md:
1. Identify expected code location
2. Verify file exists
3. Check implementation completeness
4. Count implemented vs planned functionality

### Step 3: Calculate Real Percentages
```bash
# Example: Check UI implementation
echo "=== UI Components ==="
total=$(grep -c "^- \[" Docs/Status/ProjectProgress.md)
completed=$(grep -c "^- \[x\]" Docs/Status/ProjectProgress.md)
percent=$((completed * 100 / total))
echo "Claimed vs Actual: $percent%"
```

### Step 4: Verify Against Design Docs
Cross-reference with:
- GameDesign.md for feature list
- TechnicalArchitecture.md for components
- UIScreenDesign.md for UI progress

## üìä Output Format

Create findings report at:
`/Docs/Status/Session_Findings_Project_Progress_Check.md`

Use this exact structure:

# Project Progress Check Findings

## Task Summary
[Brief description of what was checked]

## Overall Findings Summary
[High-level summary: X features checked, Y discrepancies found]

## Overall Recommendation
[Primary recommendation based on findings]

---

## Topic 1: Overstated Progress

### Problem Summary
[X features marked as more complete than actual implementation]

### Features Affected
1. `Enemy AI System` - Marked 80%, Actually ~50%
   - Missing: Pathfinding, advanced behaviors
   - Implemented: Basic movement, simple targeting
   
2. `Tower Upgrades` - Marked 60%, Actually ~30%
   - Missing: Upgrade UI, stat calculations
   - Implemented: Basic upgrade data structure

### Suggested Solution
Update percentages to reflect actual implementation

### Priority
**HIGH** - Affects project planning and expectations

### User Feedback Options
- [ ] Update all percentages immediately
- [ ] Review each with team first
- [ ] Add detailed sub-task breakdowns
- [ ] Other: _________________________

## Topic 2: Untracked Implementation

### Problem Summary
[X features implemented but not tracked in progress]

### Features Found
[List implemented features missing from tracking]

### Suggested Solution
Add implemented features to ProjectProgress.md

### Priority
**MEDIUM** - Progress higher than reported

### User Feedback Options
- [ ] Add all found features
- [ ] Update progress percentages
- [ ] Other: _________________________

[Continue for Stale Tasks, Missing Dependencies, etc.]
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

Progress tracking is accurate if:
1. All percentages within ¬±5% of reality
2. No features marked complete are broken
3. Task lists reflect actual remaining work
4. Timelines based on historical velocity
5. All major features tracked

## üìù Expected Finding Categories

1. **Overstated Progress**: Claims exceed implementation
2. **Understated Progress**: More done than tracked
3. **Stale Information**: Old percentages, dates
4. **Missing Features**: Implemented but untracked
5. **Broken "Complete" Features**: Marked done but not working
6. **Unrealistic Timelines**: Estimates ignore velocity
7. **Task List Drift**: TODOs don't match needs
8. **Dependency Issues**: Blocked items not marked

## üîß Common Progress Tracking Issues

1. **90% Syndrome**: Features stuck at 90% for weeks
2. **Binary Thinking**: 0% or 100%, no gradual progress
3. **Scope Creep**: Features grow but percentage doesn't adjust
4. **Lost Context**: Why things are blocked/delayed
5. **Optimism Bias**: Everything is "almost done"
6. **Silent Failures**: Completed features that broke

## üßπ Cleanup After Task Completion

### Temporary Files Created
During execution, this task may create:
- Feature mapping files
- Code analysis results
- Percentage calculation outputs

### Cleanup Actions
After all fixes have been implemented:

1. **Findings Report Handling**:
   - [ ] Review findings at `/Docs/Status/Session_Findings_Project_Progress_Check.md`
   - [ ] If all issues resolved, move to `/Docs/Status/old/`
   - [ ] Update ProjectProgress.md with accurate data
   - [ ] Note correction date in document

2. **Temporary Files**:
   - [ ] Delete feature mapping files
   - [ ] Remove calculation outputs
   - [ ] Clear analysis results

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - [ ] Update ProjectProgress.md with findings
   - [ ] Sync with other status documents
   - [ ] Update milestone dates if needed

4. **Future Monitoring**:
   - [ ] Schedule weekly progress updates
   - [ ] Set up progress tracking automation
   - [ ] Create velocity tracking metrics

### Retention Policy
- **Findings Reports**: Keep for 6 months for trend analysis
- **Progress History**: Maintain in version control
- **Velocity Data**: Preserve for planning
- **Correction Log**: Document all adjustments
