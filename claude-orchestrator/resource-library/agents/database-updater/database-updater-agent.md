# Database Updater Agent

## Purpose
Intelligently update the session database based on actual session content, creating meaningful savepoints that reflect what really happened rather than using static templates.

## Core Principle
**CONTEXT-AWARE UPDATES**
- Analyze session to understand what was done
- Record meaningful metrics and decisions
- Create savepoints that help future sessions
- Adapt to different types of work

## Execution Instructions

### Input Required
1. Session conversation context
2. Handover document content
3. Maintenance reports (if any)
4. Git change summary

### Read Order
1. Session handover document
2. Any maintenance reports created
3. Git status/changes

## What to Record

### Session State
- Primary accomplishment(s)
- Key decisions made
- Problems encountered
- Solutions implemented
- Patterns discovered

### Metrics to Calculate
- Files modified/created/deleted
- Documentation updates
- Code changes vs doc changes ratio
- Time spent (if available)
- Complexity of changes

### Savepoint Content
Based on session analysis, create meaningful savepoint with:
- Accurate task description
- Actual completion status
- Real blockers encountered
- Genuine next steps

## Database Schema Understanding

### session_state Table
```sql
- session_id: Unique identifier
- current_task: What was actually worked on
- task_context: Why it was important
- workflow: Which workflow was active
- status: 'active', 'ended', 'crashed'
```

### checkpoints Table  
```sql
- trigger_type: 'session_end'
- current_task: Summary of accomplishments
- completed_items: JSON of what got done
- pending_decisions: JSON of open questions
- active_issues: JSON of unresolved problems
- next_steps: Extracted from handover
```

### decisions Table
```sql
- what_was_decided: Actual decisions from session
- reason: Why decision was made
- approved_by_user: Boolean
```

### issues Table
```sql
- issue_description: Real problems encountered
- resolution_attempted: What was tried
- resolved: Whether it worked
```

## Analysis Process

### 1. Session Analysis
```python
# Pseudo-code for what agent should determine
accomplishments = extract_from_handover("completed")
failures = extract_from_handover("not completed") 
decisions = extract_key_decisions(conversation)
blockers = identify_blockers(conversation)
metrics = calculate_session_metrics()
```

### 2. Create Meaningful Update
Instead of generic "Session completed", record:
- "Implemented session-end command with parallel agent execution"
- "Refactored maintenance system to agent-based approach"
- "Fixed database schema issues and created savepoint system"

### 3. Record Valuable Context
Capture information that helps next session:
- Which approaches worked/failed
- Time-consuming tasks
- Unexpected discoveries
- Technical debt created

## Output Format

Return to orchestrator:
```json
{
  "session_summary": "Actual one-line summary",
  "accomplishments": [
    "Created session-end command",
    "Designed agent-based maintenance"
  ],
  "decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "Use agents instead of static code",
      "reason": "More flexible and maintainable"
    }
  ],
  "issues": [
    {
      "issue": "Database schema missing tables",
      "resolved": false,
      "attempted": "Created workaround"
    }
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "files_modified": 15,
    "docs_updated": 3,
    "agents_created": 2,
    "tests_run": 0
  },
  "savepoint_note": "Meaningful description for savepoint"
}
```

## Integration with Session-End

Called after:
- Handover is approved and saved
- Maintenance tasks complete
- Documentation updates done

Called before:
- Git commit
- Final session termination

## Adaptation Examples

### For Feature Implementation Session
```json
{
  "session_summary": "Implemented user authentication system",
  "metrics": {
    "endpoints_created": 4,
    "tests_written": 12,
    "security_checks": 3
  }
}
```

### For Bug Fix Session
```json
{
  "session_summary": "Fixed race condition in payment processing",
  "issues": [
    {
      "issue": "Intermittent payment failures",
      "resolved": true,
      "attempted": "Added mutex locks"
    }
  ]
}
```

### For Documentation Session
```json
{
  "session_summary": "Reorganized documentation structure",
  "metrics": {
    "docs_moved": 23,
    "indexes_updated": 3,
    "broken_links_fixed": 7
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria

The agent succeeds when:
- Database contains meaningful session record
- Savepoint helps understand what happened
- Metrics reflect actual work done
- Future sessions can learn from this one

## Remember
- Every session is different
- Generic updates help no one
- Context is king
- Quality over quantity
